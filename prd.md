Awesome — here's a clean, concise project description you can use as your **README**, PRD, or first comment for GitHub Copilot. It covers the app idea, stack, and expected structure. Feel free to tweak!

### 📘 Script Snips

A minimal but creative web app to collect and browse short fictional script snippets between one or more characters. It's like a personal archive of snippets from imagined stories, character interactions, or even solo monologues.

#### 🧠 Core Idea
Users can **submit short script snippets** consisting of one or more lines by different characters. Each "script snip" captures a moment — dramatic, funny, mysterious, etc.

No authentication required — the app is **contribution-based**, with a simple form for adding a script snip and local storage used for **favoriting** entries.

The snips can contain:
- One or more **characters**
- One or more **lines**, attributed to the characters
- An optional **title or tag** (e.g., "First Contact", "Dream Sequence")

#### 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express + TypeScript
- **Database**: Neon (PostgreSQL)
- **Frontend**: Vue.js (Vite)
- **Deployment**: Vercel for frontend, and backend (depending on availability)

#### 📦 Example Data Structure (for one Script Snip)
```ts
{
  id: "string", // unique snip ID
  title: "string", // optional
  characters: ["string", "string", ...],
  lines: [
    { speaker: "string", text: "string" },
    ...
  ],
  createdAt: "timestamp"
}
```

#### ✨ Features
- Create and submit a script snip
- View snips submitted by others
- Mark favorite snips (stored in localStorage)
- Filter by character or title keyword
- No login or user accounts
